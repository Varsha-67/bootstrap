                        Diwali, also referred to as the Festival of Lights occurs throughout India during October or November. It’s a five-day Hindu festival that honours light’s triumph over darkness and good versus evil.
                        The millions of clay lamps and candles that bejewel houses, shops, and streets produce the lights. In the night sky, fireworks make a display of light. Family get-togethers, prayers, feasting, and lighting crackers all happen. Cleaning homes is done right from top to bottom, and rangoli sand patterns are decorated with coloured. In this festive period, new clothes are put on while exchanging sweets as presents.
                        Due to its magical lighting, India’s cities become fairylands of light. Delhi, Varanasi, and Amritsar have particularly impressive Diwali festivities. For a traveller, seeing Diwali lights is an unforgettable moment.

                        <h2>3. Ganesh Chaturthi: Birth of lord Ganesha</h2>
                        Ganesh Chaturthi is a 10-day Hindu festival celebrating the birth of Lord Ganesh, who has an elephant head; he is considered the god of prosperity as well as wisdom. The biggest celebrations occur in Mumbai between August and September.
On the first day, large statues of Lord Ganesh are taken into homes or placed in public pandals (temporary structures). Pujas (prayers) are done on each day in honour of Lord Ganesha. The music then fills up the streets, which come alive with dance movements and colourful illuminations. Thousands flock to these pandals, where they can view idols along with other items.
Finally, there are grand street processions where idols are carried out to nearby water bodies for immersion.
As they dissolve, it marks Ganesh’s return to join the gods. The rite culminates with Modak treats being served. Navas shouting “Ganpati Bappa Morya!” together with everyone else makes one feel elated.

                    <h2>5. Durga puja: divine goddess celebrations</h2>
                    Durga Puja, celebrated in September or October for five days, is a Hindu festival that commemorates the victory of the divine goddess Durga over Asura Mahishasura. In Kolkata alone, there are over 10,000 temporary pandals set up all over town.
Each pandal contains clay idols of Durga, representing various forms she takes for different purposes; some display such creativity that they attract design awards, while others appear as if they were made to be covered by flowers, fabric, and jewellery pieces. Thousands come to worship these idols and take prasad (offering) from them.
At the end of these festivals, huge immersion processions follow, where idols are taken into rivers for submergence. Streets become full of music and impromptu dances with an electrifying atmosphere. Kolkata’s Durga Puja is an unmatched encounter for travellers.
